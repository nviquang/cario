# Feature Specification: Community Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-community-page`  
**Created**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add Community page with group listing and post viewing functionality"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to browse and interact with community groups and their posts, similar to how I would use Facebook groups, so that I can engage with the Cario community.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the community page, **When** I load the page, **Then** I should see a header titled "Cộng đồng Cario" and a list of my groups
2. **Given** I am viewing the groups list, **When** I enter text in the search bar, **Then** the groups list should update to show matching groups
3. **Given** I am viewing the groups list, **When** I click on a group, **Then** I should see the posts from that group displayed
4. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I access the community page, **Then** I should see my joined groups in the left sidebar

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no groups matching the search criteria?
- What happens when a selected group has no posts?
- How is the groups list paginated? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pagination details not specified]
- What happens when the APIs are not responding?
